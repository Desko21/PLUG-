How to use

Copy/paste the script into the Console of your WebBrowser

(while Plug.dj window is on focus and channel is already joined)

Or for firefox users make a new bookmark with the following code :

javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hybris95/HybrisPlugDJ/master/hybrisPlugDJ.js');}());

Or for chrome users make a new bookmark with the following code :

javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/Desko21/PLUG-/master/PLUG+.js');}());

Firefox issues

Firefox blocks mixed-content by default.

To enable it, type "about:config" in Firefox's address bar.

Then search for "security.mixed_content.block_active_content".

And set it to false (by double clicking on it).

Warning

Use autoAnswer and autoRaffle at your own risks, these issues should be fixed soon by Matthew and were developped for tests purposes.

TODO

Create a tag in the webpage for the audio instead of using mixed_content in javascript.
